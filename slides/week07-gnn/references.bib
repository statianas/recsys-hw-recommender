abstract = {Recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data have led to
state-of-the-art performance on recommender system benchmarks. However, making these
methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks with billions of
items and hundreds of millions of users remains an unsolved challenge. Here we describe
a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and deployed at Pinterest.
We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm, which combines
efficient random walks and graph convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e.,
items) that incorporate both graph structure as well as node feature information.
Compared to prior GCN approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient
random walks to structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that
relies on harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence
of the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to
generate embeddings using a trained model. Overall, we can train on and embed graphs
that are four orders of magnitude larger than typical GCN implementations. We show
how GCN embeddings can be used to make high-quality recommendations in various settings
at Pinterest, which has a massive underlying graph with 3 billion nodes representing
pins and boards, and 17 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user studies,
as well as A/B tests, our approach generates higher-quality recommendations than comparable
deep learning based systems. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest application
of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way for a new generation of web-scale
recommender systems based on graph convolutional architectures.},
